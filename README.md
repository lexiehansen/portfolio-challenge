# Portfolio Challenge
Create professional portfolio via GitHub Pages. 

Objectives:
- Create portfolio with professional photo and contact information
- Add navigation elements that link to page sections

A link to my project URL via GitHub is available [here](https://lexiehansen.github.io/portfolio/).
